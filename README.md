  ## Description
  A simple README.md file generator using the command line.

  ## Installation
  The README Generator requires installation of Node.js and the Inquirer.js package. The generator is demonstrated using VS Code and the terminal.

  ## Usage
  Once installations are complete, simply run 'node index' in the terminal and answer the questions as prompted. This will generate a new README.md file in your  directory.  
  The video below demos the user flow starting with the node index command and ending with viewing the README from the GitHub repository.
